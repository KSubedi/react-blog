# React Blog

This is one of my learning projects. This is a simple blog built with React & Redux. It uses an online public API to store and retrieve the posts.

You can use webpack to compile it. The easiest way to run it is to use `SimpleHTTPServer` with python.
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

This was just a learning project and is not meant to be used for anything serious.
